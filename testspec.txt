Objective: To validate the generateSoundex function with multiple test cases that cover a variety of scenarios, including names with different consonants, vowels, special characters, and apostrophes, ensuring the function returns the correct 4-character Soundex code.

Test Case 1: Common Name Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "Robert"
Expected Output: "R163"

Test Case 2: Name with Different Consonants Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "Ashcraft"
Expected Output: "A261"

Test Case 3: Single Character Name Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "A"
Expected Output: "A000"

Test Case 4: Name Starting with a Vowel Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "Euler"
Expected Output: "E460"

Test Case 5: Short Name with No Changes in Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "Lee"
Expected Output: "L000"

Test Case 6: Name with Special Characters in Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "B@rton"
Expected Output: "B635"

Test Case 7: Name with Apostrophe in Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "O'Connor"
Expected Output: "O256"

Test Case 8: Multi-Part Name with Apostrophe in Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "D'Artagnan"
Expected Output: "D632"

Test Case 9: Name with Repeating Letters in Soundex Conversion
Input Name: "Addams"
Expected Output: "A352"

Test Procedures:
Setup: Initialize a character array soundex[5] to store the generated Soundex code.
Execution: For each test case, call the generateSoundex function with the given input name and store the result in soundex.
Validation: Use ASSERT_STREQ to compare the generated Soundex code with the expected output for each test case.
Result: Mark the test as Pass if the generated Soundex code matches the expected output. Otherwise, mark it as Fail.

Expected Results:
The generateSoundex function should correctly handle common names, names with vowels, special characters, and apostrophes.
Names with fewer than 4 characters should be padded with zeros.
Non-alphabetic characters should be ignored, while alphabetic characters should be processed according to the Soundex rules.
The function should always return a 4-character Soundex code.
